    <strong>BTS</strong>(Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the <strong>Bangtan Boys</strong>, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
    The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
    Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.
    Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references
    literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
